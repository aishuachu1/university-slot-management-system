Slot management system for university scheduling and conflict avoidance


# University Slot Management System

## Overview
The University Slot Management System is designed to automate the allocation
of time slots in a university environment. The system helps avoid scheduling
conflicts between courses, faculty, and classrooms.

## Problem Statement
Manual scheduling of university slots is time-consuming and prone to errors
such as overlapping classes and resource conflicts. This project aims to
provide a structured and efficient solution.

## Objectives
- Automate slot allocation
- Avoid timetable conflicts
- Improve scheduling efficiency
- Reduce manual effort
- Helps students to get to know about the timetable better

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: (c++)
- Database: (to be updated)
- Tools: VS Code

## Scope
This project focuses on basic slot allocation logic and can be extended to
include web interfaces and optimization algorithms.
